# Data-Structure-Q 
DSQ is made to boost up the coding skill and understanding of data structures, including other technologies.

At current moment DSQ is a program with implementations of multiple data-structures. These implementations are covered with basic unit-tests (using Unity framework: [a link](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity).

## Getting started (local run)
Set up:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qrutyy/dsq.git
```

To add Unity as submodule:
```bash
./config.sh
```

To run (temporarily):
```bash
make test
```

## CI run
In case you dont want to run it localy, DSQ supports the CI test execution.
