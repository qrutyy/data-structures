# Data-Structure-Q [FROZEN]
DSQ is made to boost up the coding skill and understanding of data structures, including other technologies.

At current moment DSQ is a program with implementations of multiple data-structures. These implementations are covered with basic unit-tests (using Unity framework : https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity). 

## Getting started
Set up:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qrutyy/dsq.git
```

To add Unity as submodule:
```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```


To run (temporarily):
```bash
make test
```
